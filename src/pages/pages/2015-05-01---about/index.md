## I'm Dani.

People know me as a mobile app developer and "The React guy" cuz I speak about javascript and javascript frameworks like React a lot in tech events and communities in Chennai. I love programming and building cool apps. I solve problems and teach people for a living. I code by the day and sleep by the night while studying particle physics on the coffee breaks.

I'm currently working in <a href="https://pickyourtrail.com" target="_blank">Pickyourtrail</a> as their chief meme creator and also coding the intelligent travel assistant <a href="https://land.ly/45UAR4" target="_blank">"Pickyourtrail Mobile app"</a>. Pickyourtrail is redefining how people travel and I get to play a cool role on that ðŸ˜Ž


The love for software engineering is a result of my love for problem solving which is still keeping me explore different fields of science and engineering. You can checkout my blog **<a href="https://scienceandstardust.com" target="_blank">Science and StarDust</a>** where I write about the interesting things I learnt.
